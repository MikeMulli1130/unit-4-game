<p>Welcome to the guessing game "Get Crystal's Number!! In this game, you'll meet four of the lovliest "gems" on the web.</p>
<p>No, you won't get the digits to anybody's personal cel. And this will definitely be random.</p>

<p class="space"></p>

<p>To start the game, you'll be given a random number by the computer.</p>

<p class="space"></p>

<p>There are four lovely "Crystals" below. By clicking on one of their pictures, you will add a specific amount of points to your score.</p>

<p>You win the game by matching your total score to a random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

</p>
<p class="space"></p>

<p>The value of each "Crystal" is hidden from you until you click on her picture.</p>

<p>Each time the game starts, it will change the value of each Crystal. </p>

<p class="space"></p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
